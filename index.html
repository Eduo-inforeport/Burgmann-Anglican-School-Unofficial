      We're very proud of the achievements of our staff and students. This #FlashbackFriday we're looking back to 2019 when Burgmann’s former Head of Senior School and author of the BAS History Book, John Foulcher, was awarded the coveted ACU Prize for Poetry.
When asked what his poem ‘Revising Casuarinas’ is about, John explained “It’s a poem about ageing, and the solace we find in things and the things we do as we grow older. It’s about memory, love, affection and friendship.

       We are delighted to announce that the Burgmann Anglican School Board has appointed Ms Leonie Harwood as Principal from Term 1, 2022.
       Leonie’s appointment marks another milestone in our school’s history as both the third Principal and more importantly for a co-educational school, our first female Principal.
       Leonie is currently Deputy Principal and Head of Senior School at St John’s Grammar School, an Anglican ELC to year 12 school in the Adelaide Hills in South Australia. She is an inspiring, contemporary educator with a passion for academic excellence and ongoing learning for teaching staff.
       What shone brightly during the interview process was her warmth of personality and commitment to every child; she is committed to providing authentic, personalised learning experiences that give students an educational and life advantage.
       Leonie tells us: “I am excited and honoured to be appointed as the third Principal of Burgmann Anglican School. I am a strong believer in Christian education and look forward to joining Burgmann and leading a school community actively working to create a world where anything is possible for our young people grounded in faith.”
       We all look forward with great optimism to this next stage in the Burgmann story welcoming Leonie and her family to our Burgmann family next year!

      A COVID-19 Burgmann Anglican School Update – Sunday 22 August 2021.
      The School is aware of new exposure site updates by ACT Health of various bus routes servicing Gungahlin. We understand you may have concerns about the status of school bus routes for our School.
      Burgmann Anglican School bus services are not currently listed as exposure sites. Should this situation change, we will advise our parents and staff via our official communication channels, the Portal and direct email. As always, we strongly encourage our community to follow the advice of ACT Health.
      ACT Health regularly updates the listing of exposure sites. If you or your family have been to any listed exposure locations at the dates and times specified, including any of the public transport options listed, you should monitor for symptoms, quarantine and/or get tested for COVID-19 as advised by ACT Health.
      If you are directed by ACT Health to get tested for COVID-19 or to isolate at any time, we urge our community to follow those directions.
      The best action we can all take is to stay locked down and limit our movements for this seven day period. If you feel unwell, get tested. If you are able to, get vaccinated.
      To keep our community safe, follow ACT Health directions and advice at all times.
      
      <b>ACT Government Advice:</b>
      <b>1.</b> Being part of a school community is an exciting time for children and young people as well as their families.

      Making sure you are prepared and know what to expect will enhance your child’s school experience.
      
      -School hours
      -Attendance
      -Before and after school care
      -Uniforms
      -Term dates
      -Concerns and complaints

      <b>2.</b>Schools are open Monday to Friday across four terms each year. Please see term dates and public holidays for details.

      Schools set the hours for their students according to the needs of their community. Please contact your school for hours and timetable details.

      <b>3.</b>Regular attendance at school is important for your child’s intellectual, social, emotional and physical development.

      All children and young people in the ACT are required to participate in fulltime education from six years of age until they complete Year 10. Young people are then required to participate in fulltime in education, training or employment until they complete Year 12 or they turn 17, whichever happens first. The Education Participation (Enrolment and Attendance Policy) has further details.
      
      If your child is unable to attend, you are required to let your school know they will not be at the school on the day or for a certain period. Each school has its own attendance procedures, please contact your school for details.
      
      <b>4.</b> Before and after school care is available at many ACT public schools, providing a safe, supervised, stimulating environment for students. These sessions focus on providing students with an opportunity to socialise, develop new skills, have fun, do homework and relax.

      The before and after school care hours can vary from school to school, however, generally run from between 7 and 7.30 am to 9 am and from the final bell to 6 pm. Holiday programs are also offered at many schools.
      
      Please check your school’s website or contact the school for specific times.

      <b>5.</b> Each school determines its own uniforms and dress standards. Most schools have a uniform or a colour code.

      School uniforms promote a sense of belonging among students, make school clothing more affordable, promote the safety of students through easier identification and help students learn the importance of appropriate presentation.
      
      Schools work with their community to ensure that uniforms:
      
      are comfortable, hard-wearing and affordable for families
      provide adequate sun protection
      are suitable for all students regardless of gender identity, preferred presentation, ethnicity, religion, age, pregnancy or body shape
      are appropriate for students with disabilities
      are sourced from ethical producers
      comply with all health and safety, human rights and anti-discrimination laws.
      Please check your school’s website or contact your school for details and see the dress standards and uniforms policy and related documents for more information about uniforms in ACT public schools.
      
      <b>6.</b>If you have a concern or complaint about your child’s schooling, education or welfare:

      Step 1: Discuss your concern with your child’s teacher.
      
      Step 2: Discuss your concern with the school principal (if you were not able to resolve the concern with the teacher or if you concern relates to the conduct of a staff member or is about another aspect of school life).
      
      Step 3: If your concern remains unresolved, contact the Feedback and Complaints Unit via the ACT Education Directorate contact form or by phone (02) 6205 5429 between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.
